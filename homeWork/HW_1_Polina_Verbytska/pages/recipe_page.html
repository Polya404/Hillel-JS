        <p>In Kievan Rus, borscht was prepared from edible hogweed leaves—hence the name. Later they began to cook it
            with beets, and from the 19th century they added potatoes.</p>

        <ol>
            <li><b>Make the broth</b></li>
            <li><b>Make a roast</b></li>
            <li><b>Assemble the borscht</b></li>
        </ol>
        <mark><b>1</b></mark>
        <p>Pour cold water into the pan, add the meat and place over medium heat. The broth will be tastier if you use
            meat
            on the bone.
        </p>

        <br>
        <p>Keep an eye on the broth and skim off the foam before boiling.
            When the liquid boils, cover the pan with a lid and simmer over low heat for an hour and a half.
        </p>
        <br>
        <mark><b>2</b></mark>
        <p>Wash and peel the beets, carrots and onions. Grate the beets on a coarse grater, and grate the carrots on a
            medium grater. Cut the onion into small cubes.
            Pour oil into the pan, turn on medium heat. Fry the onions and carrots, stirring, for about 5 minutes.

        <p>Then add the beets. Add citric acid, vinegar or lemon juice to it. Thanks to this, the borscht will be truly
            red
            and acquire a pleasant sourness.

            When the broth is cooked, remove the meat from it. While it cools, add shredded cabbage to the pan. After
            5-10
            minutes, add the potatoes cut into strips or cubes.

            The order in which the vegetables are added can be changed. If the cabbage is young, it is better to add it
            after the potatoes. Well, or at the same time, if your potato variety boils quickly.

            While the potatoes are cooking, remove the meat from the bone and cut into cubes. Return it to the soup. Add
            salt to taste.
            Add the roast and stir.

            Throw in the bay leaf and finely chopped herbs. Cover the pan with a lid and cook for another 5-7 minutes.
            For flavor, you can add a little chopped garlic, ground cloves or black pepper to the pan. Leave the borscht
            to
            steep under the lid for 5–10 minutes.

        <h2>How to serve borscht</h2>
        <p>Borscht can be eaten immediately after cooking. But, as a rule, it tastes even better the next day.

            Add sour cream and fresh herbs to the plate. If you prefer it sour, add a slice of lemon.

            Serve the borscht with rye bread or buns rubbed with garlic. The dish is also perfectly complemented by lard
            and donuts.</p>
