        <h2>My hobbies</h2>
        <p>Since childhood, I have been swimming professionally for 13 years. Besides sports, I love solving puzzles,
            and one of my hobbies is collecting Rubik's cubes. There are more than 20 different cubes in my collection.
            After entering university, I became interested in electronics based on Arudino microcontrollers, after which
            I took up programming.
        </p>
        <h2>The purpose of training</h2>
        <p>I already have experience developing a backend in Java, but I want to improve my skills in order to find a
            higher paying position, be able to use different technologies and be able to independently write a project
            with a backend and frontend. At the moment I am writing a pet project for an online store and by the end of
            the course my goal is to be able to write the front part correctly and beautifully with my knowledge and
            correctly configure the interactions between the frontend and backend</p>
        <h2>My interests</h2>
        <p>My interests are the Marvel cinematic universe, I love comics, my brother and I have a small collection.
            Sometimes I like to watch anime such as one piece, bleach, fairy tail, naruto. Here are the top three of my
            favorite films :</p>
